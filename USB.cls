%     Original Instructions And Hints
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This file provides the LaTeX2e style myeasychithesis for formating
% graduate thesis at the University Putra Malaysia. It was written by
% Rand Alfaris. For an example of its use see the
% file: Randtemplate.tex, and the instructions below.
%
% Comments or problems should be sent to randalfaris@gmail.com
%
%
% Invoking this style:  Start your document with (this is 1.5 spaced)
%
%   \documentclass{myeasychithesis2}
%
% You should submit a double-spaced thesis.  So, start with
%
%   \documentclass[truedoublespace]{myeasychithesis2}
%
% When printing drafts, you may not want your thesis doublespaced.
% If you use instead:
%
%   \documentclass[singlespace]{myeasychithesis2}
%
% or
%
%   \documentclass[onehalfspace]{myeasychithesis2}
%
% your thesis will come out single or 3/2 spaced respectively.
% myeasychithesis2 also understands all options understood by report.
% Also the ``double spacing'' provided by this style is not ``true''
% doublespacing as defined by setspace.sty.  Instead, it is the same
% as on the old LaTeX 2.09 thesis style ``chithesis''.  If you want
% ``true'' double spacing, give the option truedoublespace.
%
% Title Page Information Commands
%    Example Usage:
%       \title{Decimal numbers on cryptography}
%       \author{Rand Q. Alfaris}
%       \department{Mathematics}
%       \division{Pure Mathematics}  (Sciences with an s!)
%       \degree{Doctor of Philosophy}
%       \date{}    
%       \maketitle
%
% \dedication : Use for a dedication, copyright, or epigraph.
%               Produces a page with no number for the text which follows
%               If you want centering, do it yourself with
%               \begin{center} and \end{center}.
%        Usage:
%           \dedication
%           To... .
%
% \topmatter : Things like Abstract, Acknowledgments.
%    Usage:
%       \topmatter{Title Of Matter}
%
%       Use like \chapter, once for each page of matter you want.  Don't
%       use numbered sections within these.  Use \section* instead.
%
% The abstract environment has been changed to invoke \topmatter.
% The acknowledgment environment has been changed to invoke
% \topmatter, use it like the aastex acknowledgment command but put
% it at beginning of document for a UPM Thesis
%
% \mainmatter : Signals the start of the document's body.
%    Usage:
%       \mainmatter
%
%       Use once before the first numbered \chapter.
%
%  HINTS:
%
%  1.  To get appendices, you don't do anything different from a normal
%     report document.  That means, put the command \appendix before
%     you begin your first appendix, then do each appendix with a
%     \chapter command.  Note that if you have only one appendix, it is
%     customary to leave it unnumbered.  Do this with \chapter*.
%
%  2. If you are having page break problems (which are much more
%     likely in double spacing), use the \pagebreak[n] and
%     \nopagebreak[n] commands to tell LaTeX good and bad 
%     places for page breaks. n=1,2,3 for gradually more
%     emphatic suggestion to LaTeX. n=4 is almost always
%     break page or almost never break page.
%
%  3. If you are in a rush and don't have time to go through and
%     rework places which generate overfull hboxes (stuff sticking
%     out from right margin), put the command \sloppy before your
%     \begin{document}. LaTeX will not generate overfull hboxes but will
%     stretch spaces more, beyond its usual aesthetic preferences.
%
%  KNOWN PROBLEMS
%
%  1.  No support for multi-volume theses.
%
%  2.  Doesn't work with older versions of setspace.sty
%
%  3.  Problems with math formulas in chapter headings:
%
%         a.  Any lowercase letters in the formula are converted to
%         uppercase, e.g. f(x) becomes F(X).   If you really need
%         lowercase math letters in your chapter titles, use the
%         option plainchapterheads (and, if you want, type your
%         chapter titles in ALL CAPS so that the appearance doesn't
%         change).  Note there is no problem
%         for section or subsection headings in either case.
%
%         b.  Some perfectly reasonable math commands when used in
%         \chapter give the error
%          ``LATEX ERROR: \command  ALLOWED ONLY IN MATH MODE.''
%         The solution to this is to do
%
%              \newcommand{\mymath}{problem math goes here}
%
%         and then
%
%              \chapter{All about \protect\mymath}
%
%         also, the option plainchapterheads will fix this too.
%
%  Improvements over older versions:
%
%  Added in 1.4: Name of the bibiography is now References, to please the
%  thesis office.  If you want to change it back, put
%
%   \renewcommand{\bibname}{Bibliography}
%
%  in your TeX file prior to \begin{document}
